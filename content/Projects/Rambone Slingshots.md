Series: Rambone

Liam's been fascinated by sling shots for a couple of years. He did a lot of research (aka watching YouTube), and discovered [**Joerg Sprave**](http://www.slingshotchannel.com/index.html) and his excellent [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVZlxkKqlvVqzRJXhAGq42Q).

Eventually, via YouTube and various sling shot online forums he found some [collected instructions](http://simple-shot.com/build-your-own-rambone/), which includes a PDF template for cutting out plywood by hand. As well, there's an STL model file (more on using that later.)

There's also great video tutorial for how to build one:

More on the build coming soon.
