<p>We have two Lulzbot Taz printers that are ready to print your designs!</p>

<p>These are great machines that offer larger-than average build volumes: approximately 25cm x 25cm x 23cm.</p>

<p>We regularly print in PLA, PET-G, and ABS and can configure our machines to meet your needs- be it speed of service, strength, or finish quality.</p>

<p>All our machines have been upgraded with all-metal hotends. This means we can also print with more exotic materials such as polycarbonate and nylon.</p>

<p>We also plan to support printing in flexible materials in the near future.</p>

<p>To start printing your design just <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a> directly, or <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com/vancouver/hubs/makefamilyfun" data-3dhubs-widget="button" data-hub-id="55116" data-type="orderWidget" data-color="light" data-size="small" data-text="Order a 3D Print">Order a 3D Print</a> <script>!function(a,b,c,d){var e,g=(a.getElementsByTagName(b)[0],/^http:/.test(a.location)?"http":"https");a.getElementById(d)||(e=a.createElement(b),e.id=d,e.src=g+"://d3d4ig4df637nj.cloudfront.net/w/2.0.js",e.async=!0,a.body.appendChild(e))}(document,"script",1,"h3d-widgets-js");</script> from our Hub on 3D Hubs.

<p>Have an idea but don't know how to use CAD programs? We can help.</p>

<p>We have experience with AutoDesk 123D Design, AutoDesk 360 Fusion, as well as FreeCad and OpenSCAD.</p>

<p>Working with you, we will create a CAD design that is optimized for 3D printing, and provide you with all the final design files.</p>

<p>We can also help with existing designs that need tweaking for 3D printing- including mesh based designs created with tools such as Skulptris, MudBox, or Blender.</p>
