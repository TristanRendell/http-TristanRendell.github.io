# We Want to hear from You!

Our goal is to serve you, the public of Rinchmond, and the greater Vancouver area.

Your ideas and suggestions are really important to us. All feedback will be read, thought about, and when possible, added to our [plans]({filename}/pages/plans.md).

You can send feedback at any time, from any page, by clicking on the <a href="#" onclick="_urq.push(['Feedback_Open'])">smiley-faced-speech bubble</a> that appears on the left.

Or you can go to our [user feedback forum](https://feedback.userreport.com/fc6fed16-1f42-4935-ba53-e8aa8a138e1f/), which should also appear below! We're using [User Report](https://userreport.com/).

Thanks in advance,

Julian

On behalf of the MakeItZone team.
