<p>Many students are a little fearful of building with technology. To help them a plethora of wonderful learning tools have been created. For example, Lego&reg; MindStorms&reg;. However they are often expensive, and not something that people are willing to immediately invest in. Instead of using tools, we use our experience and knowledge to quickly build students confidence and competence beyond their initial trepidation. So that they can use less expensive items such as <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard">solder-less breadboards</a>, <a href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a> and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a>. These items are so inexpensive that students can have their own set at home and practice what they have learned. And practice is a key part of learning any new skill.</p>
<p>We endeavor to ensure that everything we use in our classes can be easily sourced at reasonable prices, or is available locally as an inexpensive service.</p>
