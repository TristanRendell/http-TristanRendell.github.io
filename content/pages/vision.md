People are leaving the MakeItZone carrying smiles, and interesting items- a stool, clothing that glows, a satchel.
As many, of varying ages, are entering.
There is a palpable energy and excitement in the air.

<em class="lead">Welcome to MakeItZone. The place to make your dreams real, and to learn by doing.  A safe and welcoming space for people with different skill sets and interests to meet, learn, and work on their projects. Building community. Building the future.</em>

Our plan is to create a for profit __Makerspace__ here in Richmond, that is accessible to all ages, including elementary school children.

#### What is a Makerspace?

> To describe them simply, makerspaces are community centers with tools. Makerspaces combine manufacturing equipment, community, and education for the purposes of enabling community members to design, prototype and create manufactured works that wouldnâ€™t be possible to create with the resources available to individuals working alone. These spaces can take the form of loosely-organized individuals sharing space and tools, for-profit companies, non-profit corporations, organizations affiliated with or hosted within schools, universities or libraries, and more. All are united in the purpose of providing access to equipment, community, and education, and all are unique in exactly how they are arranged to fit the purposes of the community they serve.

__from [Makerspace.com](http://spaces.makerspace.com)__

This video does a great job of illustrating the concept:

And [this article](http://oedb.org/ilibrarian/a-librarians-guide-to-makerspaces/) has a lot of good information, from a librarian's point of view.

Makerspaces (also known as Hackspaces) are becoming very popular. There are several across BC, including Vancouver ([VHS](https://hackspace.ca/wp/), [MakerLabs](http://www.makerlabs.com)), North Vancouver ([Zen Maker Lab](http://zenmakerlab.com)), Surrey ([Maker Cube](http://makercube.ca)), and Victoria ([Victoria Makerspace](http://www.makerspace.ca/cpages/home)). They've even be written about in the [Georgia Straight](http://www.straight.com/life/734836/makerspaces-connect-people-and-projects-vancouver).

Richmond needs it's own Makerspace!

#### Why for profit?

We want to create a space that can provide well maintained and up-to-date equipment that supports individuals, groups, students and entrepreneurs.

When you have a question or concern we want there to be a paid staff member on hand to provide answers, support, and suggestions.

#### When?

We are bootstrapping this by offering educational and skill-building courses. When they are providing enough revenue we will be in a position to find and rent space.

#### How can I help?

Enroll in a class, subscribe to our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/makeitzone001) channel, support us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/MakeItZone), give us feedback, or send us an email.

We're also looking for (inexpensive!) space- please contact us if you can help!

And if you have good condition equipment that you want to donate then we would be glad to talk with you. However please be aware that our storage space is very limited until we have a location.
